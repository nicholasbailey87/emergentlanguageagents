# emergentlanguageagents
A repository of emergent language agent architectures

This was originally seeded from https://github.com/jayelm/emergent-generalization/tree/master/code/models (and particularly the code in that folder that is needed to reproduce ["Emergent Communication of Generalizations"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02668) but has since taken on a life of its own.
